5.	Application Description
    a.	Trip Friend is a software most similar to that of a ride-sharing application with some differences.
    The purpose of this application is to help individuals find rides to various locations like an Uber
    but instead of an experience designed for one person, Trip Friend is designed for multiple people.

    The original idea was that for example, if you wanted to take a trip to Breckenridge to do some skiing
    in Colorado, you could use [name] to in essence book a trip with one or more people to avoid having to
    find transportation for yourself or pay for a bus or uber. The idea is that there is a driver and their
    passengers, the driver provides the means of transportation, assumed to be a car, and the other individuals
    will pay for gas. This same logic can be applied to other high-travel areas like supermarkets and whatnot.

    The app calculates distances and monetary amounts while keeping track of users and their ratings.
    Trip Friend functions on a goodwill basis assuming people are willing to transport others.
6.	Vision Statement
    a.	To provide simple transportation at the touch of a button, to connect people and the places they want to be.
