TA Meeting 3

The purpose of this meeting was to demonstrate the progress that the group had made since the last TA meeting. All members of the group were able to complete their assigned tasks, and the functionality of the various pages was implemented. It was now possible to log in to the site and view a dynamically generated home page. From there, users could navigate to the various other pages, such as the Trip Creation page and the other pages that had been listed in the previous meeting. Unfortunately, some bugs on the main branch prevented some group members from demonstrating their code. However, there was proof that their code was working on their branches. This was a minor setback, but the group was confident that they would be able to resolve the bugs in the main branch in time for the next meeting. Overall, the meeting was a success. The group was able to demonstrate their progress and show that they were on track to complete the project on time. The group's next steps are to ensure that the website can interact with all its other moving parts and that things are working cleanly for the final presentation.
