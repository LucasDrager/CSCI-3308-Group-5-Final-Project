Team meeting 2

This meeting was mostly a discussion of what needs to be accomplished and what support each team member needs to achieve those goals. The main objective is to implement functionality into the website rather than just making it look pretty. This means that the team needs to focus on creating features that will allow users to interact with the website in a meaningful way, such as being able to search for information, sign up for an account, or make a purchase. To achieve this goal, the team will need to work together to identify and prioritize the most important features, as well as determine how to best implement them. The team will also need to provide each other with support and feedback throughout the process, to ensure that the website is developed in a cohesive and user-friendly way.
