Technology Stack used for the project:


Prerequisites to run the application:
To run this application locally the user must have a terminal and the docker engine software.
The application uses docker to build its necessary parts. To view the application the user must also have some web-based
platform to view the application. (Something like google chrome, microsoft edge, etc...) The user will also need to be able to run terminal commands
that are to be listed below.


Instructions on how to run the application locally:
To run the machine locally the user must have the docker engine running and some sort of terminal to run docker commands.
Once those two things are complete to start up the application, the user must enter this docker command into the terminal:
```docker-compose up```
which will start the program. To successfully teardown the application for local machines the user must enter this command into the terminal:
```docker-compose down -v```


How to run the tests:
Simply run the the previous commands for how to run the machine locally and the tests will run automatically before the start of the application.
